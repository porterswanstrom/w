<h2>About</h2>
<p> I started this site for fun but it was also a great excuse
to learn html, css, and git.</p>

<h2>Logs</h2>

<h3>02/04/24</h3>
<p>Decided to create a page for the various <a href="/forms">WinForms</a>
that I've made throughout my classes in college. Also changed this site's
theme quite a bit since the last log.</p>

<h3>12/31/23</h3>
<p>Just got the domain name porterswanstrom.com and created two
A records, one for w.porterswanstrom.com and the other for
dev.porterswanstrom.com which is setup to auto-redeploy
everytime a change is made to this site so that the changes
can be tested before being deployed to w.porterswanstrom.com.</p>

<h3>12/18/23</h3>
<p>Figured out how to get the spacing and font size to work right
on mobile, so now this site looks great on mobile.</p>

<h3>12/13/23</h3>
<p>Designed a light mode for this site and added css to set the
theme depending on whether someone is using dark mode or light mode.</p>

<h3>12/10/23</h3>
<p>Finally added some color to this site, it's currently dark mode with
green links, a lot of redish orange headers, and a few purple headers.</p>

<h3>12/09/23</h3>
<p>Just started this site on the 6th and so far the only pages are the
<a href="/">homepage</a>, <a href="/proj">projects</a> page,
and <a href="/site">about</a> page. Also started to add some basic css
and successfully got a working header and footer.</p>
