<h2>About</h2>
<p> I built this site for fun but it was also a great excuse to learn html,
css, and git.</p>

<h2>Logs</h2>
<h3>12/31/23</h3>
<p>I got the domain name porterswanstrom.com and created two A records,
one for w.porterswanstrom.com and the other for dev.porterswanstrom.com.
I've setup dev.porterswanstrom.com to auto-redeploy every time I make a
change to the website so that I can test the website before deploying to
w.porterswanstrom.com.</p>

<h3>12/18/23</h3>
<p>I figured out how to get the font size to work right on mobile, so now the
website looks great on mobile.</p>

<h3>12/13/23</h3>
<p>Today I designed a light mode for the website and added css to set the
theme depending on whether someone is using dark mode or light mode.</p>

<h3>12/10/23</h3>
<p>I finally added some color to the website, it's currently dark mode with
green links, a lot of redish orange headers, and a few purple headers.</p>

<h3>12/09/23</h3>
<p>I just started the website on the 6th and so far the only pages are the
homepage, projects page, and about page. I also started to add some basic
css and successfully got a working header and footer.</p>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>The source code is <a href="http://gh.porterswanstrom.com/www">here</a>
