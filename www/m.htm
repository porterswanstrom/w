<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p>I started this site to have something to do during my
break before the 2024 fall semester began, it turned out
to be a fantastic excuse to learn HTML, CSS, and Git</p>

<h2>LOG</h2>
<h3>06/15/24</h3>
<p>I redid the header and made the CSS look nicer. There's
also been lots of minor improvements like having newlines
in the correct spots and lots of rewording. This site is
now in a fairly stable state, so most important changes
will be from either adding new pages or totally redesigning
something</p>

<h3>03/25/24</h3>
<p>Every page has been moved to its own directory so that
this site can use URL slugs without relying on a framework
or web server. Now the URL of every page looks much cleaner.
There is also an <a href="../err">error</a> page now so when
someone tries going to a page that doesn't exist like
<a href="../nonexistent">this</a> one, they're sent to an
error page and then redirected to the <a href="..">main</a>
page after a few seconds</p>

<h3>02/04/24</h3>
<p>There's now a page for the various <a href="/forms">
WinForms</a> that I've made throughout my classes in college.
I also changed this site's theme quite a bit since the last
log</p>

<h3>12/31/23</h3>
<p>I got the domain name porterswanstrom.com and created two
A records, one for w.porterswanstrom.com and another for
dev.porterswanstrom.com. the latter is setup to auto-redeploy
everytime a change is made to this site, so that the changes
can be tested before being deployed to w.porterswanstrom.com
</p>

<h3>12/18/23</h3>
<p>I figured out how to get the spacing and font size to work
right on mobile, so now this site looks great on mobile</p>

<h3>12/13/23</h3>
<p>I designed a light mode for this site and added CSS to set
the theme depending on whether someone is using dark mode or
light mode</p>

<h3>12/10/23</h3>
<p>This site has some color now, it's currently dark mode
with green links, a lot of redish orange headers, and a few
purple headers</p>

<h3>12/09/23</h3>
<p>I started this site on the 6th and so far the only pages
are the <a href="..">main</a> page, <a href="../p">
projects</a> page, and <a href="../www">about</a> page. I
also started to add some basic CSS and successfully got a
working header and footer</p>
