<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p> I started this site for fun but it was also a great
excuse to learn html, css, and git</p>

<h2>LOG</h2>

<h3>03/25/24</h3>
<p>Every page has been moved to its own directory so that
this site can use url slugs without relying on a framework
or web server. Now the url of every page looks much cleaner.
There is also an <a href="../err">error</a> page now so when
someone tries going to a page that doesn't exist like
<a href="../nonexistent">this</a> one, they're sent to an
error page and then redirected to the <a href="..">main</a>
page after a few seconds</p>

<h3>02/04/24</h3>
<p>Decided to create a page for the various <a href="/forms">
WinForms</a> that I've made throughout my classes in college.
I also changed this site's theme quite a bit since the last
log</p>

<h3>12/31/23</h3>
<p>Got the domain name porterswanstrom.com and created two
A records, one for w.porterswanstrom.com and another for
dev.porterswanstrom.com which is setup to auto-redeploy
everytime a change is made to this site so that the changes
can be tested before being deployed to w.porterswanstrom.com
</p>

<h3>12/18/23</h3>
<p>Figured out how to get the spacing and font size to work
right on mobile, so now this site looks great on mobile</p>

<h3>12/13/23</h3>
<p>Designed a light mode for this site and added css to set
the theme depending on whether someone is using dark mode or
light mode</p>

<h3>12/10/23</h3>
<p>Finally added some color to this site, it's currently
dark mode with green links, a lot of redish orange headers,
and a few purple headers</p>

<h3>12/09/23</h3>
<p>Started this site on the 6th and so far the only pages
are the <a href="..">main</a> page, <a href="../proj">
projects</a> page, and <a href="../www">about</a> page. I
also started to add some basic css and successfully got a
working header and footer</p>
