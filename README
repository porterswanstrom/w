This site started as something interesting for me to work
on during my break after the fall semester of 2024 ended.
It's turned out to be a fantastic excuse to learn HTML,
CSS, and Git

There's now sitemap navigation which makes jumping to a
specific page easy, it also works great for documenting the
purpose of each page. I also added a photo of myself to the
header, making it less plain/empty looking. The header photo
also works great as a favicon. Another thing I did was adding
backgrounds, one for dark mode and one for light mode. I'm
not sure how long I'll end up keeping the backgrounds, but
they're fun for the time being

I redid the header and made the CSS look nicer. There's also
been lots of minor improvements like having newlines in the
correct spots and lots of rewording. This site is now in a
fairly stable state, so most important changes will be from
either adding new pages or totally redesigning something

Every page has been moved to its own directory so that this
site can use URL slugs without relying on a framework or web
server. Now the URL of every page looks much cleaner. There
is also an error page now so when someone tries going to a
page that doesn't exist they're sent to an error page and
then redirected to the main page after a few seconds

There's now a page for the various WinForms that I've made
throughout my classes in college. I also changed this site's
theme quite a bit since the last log

I got the domain name porterswanstrom.com and created two
A records, one for plain porterswanstrom.com and another for
w.porterswanstrom.com. the latter is setup to auto-redeploy
everytime a change is made to this site, so that the changes
can be tested before being deployed to porterswanstrom.com

I figured out how to get the spacing and font size to work
right on mobile, so now this site looks great on mobile

2023/12/13
I designed a light mode for this site and added CSS to set
the theme depending on whether someone is using dark mode
or light mode

2023/12/10
This site has some color now, it's currently dark mode with
green links, a lot of redish orange headers, and a few
purple headers

2023/12/09
I started this site on the 6th and so far the only pages
are the homepage, projects page, and about page. I also
started to add some basic CSS and successfully got a
working header and footer
