### WWW

This is the source code for http://w.porterswanstrom.com,
currently it's just a few html files and one css file that
I host as a static site on kinsta.

### LOG

#### 03/25/24
Every page has been moved to its own directory so that this
site can use url slugs without relying on a framework or web
server. Now the url of every page looks much cleaner. There
is also an error page now so when someone tries going to a
page that doesn't exist they're sent to an error page and
then redirected to the main page after a few seconds.

#### 02/04/24
Decided to create a page for the various WinForms that I've
made throughout my classes in college. I also changed this
site's theme quite a bit since the last log.

#### 12/31/23
Just got the domain name porterswanstrom.com and created two
A records, one for w.porterswanstrom.com and the other for
dev.porterswanstrom.com which is setup to auto-redeploy
everytime a change is made to this site so that the changes
can be tested before being deployed to w.porterswanstrom.com.

#### 12/18/23
Figured out how to get the spacing and font size to work
right on mobile, so now this site looks great on mobile.

#### 12/13/23
Designed a light mode for this site and added css to
set the theme depending on whether someone is using dark
mode or light mode.

#### 12/10/23
Finally added some color to this site, it's currently
dark mode with green links, a lot of redish orange headers,
and a few purple headers.

#### 12/09/23
Just started this site on the 6th and so far the only
pages are the homepage, projects page, and about page.
I also started to add some basic css and successfully
got a working header and footer.
