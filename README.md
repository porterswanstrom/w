## Web

This is the source code for my website. Currently It's just a few html
files and one css file that I host as a static site on kinsta.

I just started my website on the 6th, I'm hosting it on kinsta and so far the
only pages are the homepage, projects page, and this page. I also started to add
some basic css and successfully got a working header and footer.

I finally added some color to my website, it's currently dark mode with green
links, a lot of redish orange headers, and a few purple headers.

Today I designed a light mode for the website and added css to set the
theme depending on whether someone is using dark mode or light mode.
