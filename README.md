This is the source code for http://PorterSwanstrom.com, currently
it's just a few html files and one css file that I host as a static
site on kinsta.

I got the domain name porterswanstrom.com and created two A records, one
linking to the main website and the other linking to dev.porterswanstrom.com.
I've setup dev.porterswanstrom.com to auto-redeploy every time I make a
change to the website so that I can test the website before deploying to
porterswanstrom.com. I also made it so the website will auto-redirect
www.porterswanstrom.com to porterswanstrom.com.

I figured out how to get the font size to work right on mobile, so now
my website looks great on mobile.

#### 12/13/23
Today I designed a light mode for the website and added css to set the
theme depending on whether someone is using dark mode or light mode.

#### 12/10/23
I finally added some color to the website, it's currently dark mode with
green links, a lot of redish orange headers, and a few purple headers.

#### 12/09/23
I just started my website on the 6th and so far the only pages are
the homepage, projects page, and about page. I also started to add
some basic css and successfully got a working header and footer.
