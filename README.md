### ABOUT

I started this site to have something to do during my break
before the 2024 fall semester began, it turned out to be a
fantastic excuse to learn HTML, CSS, and Git

### LOG

#### 06/15/24
I redid the header and made the CSS look nicer. There's also
been lots of minor improvements like having newlines in the
correct spots and lots of rewording. This site is now in a
fairly stable state, so most important changes will be from
either adding new pages or totally redesigning something

#### 03/25/24
Every page has been moved to its own directory so that this
site can use URL slugs without relying on a framework or web
server. Now the URL of every page looks much cleaner. There
is also an error page now so when someone tries going to a
page that doesn't exist they're sent to an error page and
then redirected to the main page after a few seconds

#### 02/04/24
There's now a page for the various WinForms that I've made
throughout my classes in college. I also changed this site's
theme quite a bit since the last log

#### 12/31/23
I got the domain name porterswanstrom.com and created two
A records, one for w.porterswanstrom.com and another for
dev.porterswanstrom.com. the latter is setup to auto-redeploy
everytime a change is made to this site, so that the changes
can be tested before being deployed to w.porterswanstrom.com

#### 12/18/23
I figured out how to get the spacing and font size to work
right on mobile, so now this site looks great on mobile

#### 12/13/23
I designed a light mode for this site and added CSS to set
the theme depending on whether someone is using dark mode
or light mode

#### 12/10/23
This site has some color now, it's currently dark mode with
green links, a lot of redish orange headers, and a few
purple headers

#### 12/09/23
I started this site on the 6th and so far the only pages
are the homepage, projects page, and about page. I also
started to add some basic CSS and successfully got a
working header and footer
